# LeetCode-Practices

These are the some coding programs I did from LeetCode.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HeightChecker: 

A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array expected where expected[i] is the expected height of the ith student in line.

You are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each heights[i] is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed).

Return the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i].

Fizz Buzz:

Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:

answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.

Reverse String:

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Defanging an ip address:

Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address.

A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Merge Two Sorted Lists:

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sqrt(x):
https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/

Given a non-negative integer x, compute and return the square root of x.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only the integer part of the result is returned.

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in exponent function or operator, such as pow(x, 0.5) or x ** 0.5.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reverse Words in a String:

Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Integer To Binary:

Given a base-10 integer, , convert it to binary (base-2). Then find and print the base-10 integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive 1's in n's binary representation. When working with different bases, it is common to show the base as a subscript.
